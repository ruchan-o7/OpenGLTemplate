# Opengl Template

This template aims to bootstrap opengl app with builtin imgui, glm and glfw. Currently works on windows. General structure of this template was **heavily** inspired by [Walnut](https://github.com/StudioCherno/Walnut) framework. Basically cmake version of walnut but **OpenGL**. If you want to develop something with vulkan go ahead with walnut.

## Disclamier

I'm not expert of cmake as you can guess. Any pr for configuring cmake will appreciate.

# Getting Started

Just run generate-\*.bat file one you want. It will generate build files. Run build.bat for building. Run run.bat.

## 3rd parties

- **Glfw** for windowing
- **Glm** for common math
- **imgui** for immediate ui
